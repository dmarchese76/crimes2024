    <h1>Reported Rapes in NYC Up Nearly 20% in 2024 </h1>
    <h2>Manhattan neighborhoods like Times Square and Chelsea experience sharp increases as reporting rates rise.</h2>
    <h4>Delfina Marchese </h4>
    	<p> Nearly 20 percent more rapes have been reported in New York City to date in 2024 compared to 2023, according to NYPD data published and updated weekly.</p>
		<p> In Manhattan, the Times Square area saw the most significant increase, with reported cases doubling to 29 this year compared to 14 in 2023. A similar trend was observed in the Chelsea and Hudson Yards neighborhoods, which reported 14 cases this year, up from five in 2023.</p>
		<iframe title="Reported cases of rape have increased in nearly every precinct across NYC" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-cgoTq" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/cgoTq/8/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="789" data-external="1"></iframe>
		<p> A press release from the NYPD released on December 3rd said: “Year to date in 2024, major crime across New York City is reduced 1.9%,” Including significant decreases in murders, robberies and burglary. However, it also acknowledges a rise in rape, with 46 additional cases reported in November, nearly half of which originated from incidents in prior years and weren't reported until now. </p>
		<p> Police commissioner Jessica S. Tisch said in the announcement that she attributes the crime reduction to strategic deployment and increased patrol efforts.</p>
		<P> Associate professor of John Jay College of Criminal Justice said that he can't say what contributes to the growth in rape cases in NYC. “ It could be something simple, increases in the reporting rate,” he said . “ or it could be much higher counts or incidents.”  </P>
